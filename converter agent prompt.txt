Generate a user-friendly, interactive program that converts a provided .sgm file to multiple XML files. The SGML file is an older Interactive Electronic Technical Manual (IETM) that follows a DTD. Ask the user to provide the DTD. The XML output must contain one publication module and nested data modules. The XML must follow .xsd files that provide instructions for organizing and characterizing the elements in the XML IETM. The XML must also follow S1000D 4.0.1 standards. This program should be able to connect to an LLM each time the user provides more files or any other information. Also, all user interactions with the program should happen in a user-friendly GUI--not a terminal window.
